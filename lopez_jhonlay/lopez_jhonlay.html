        <h2>My Interest and Hobbies</h2>
        <ul class="interest-hobbies">
            <li>Singing</li>
            <p>
                Singing is my way of expressing myself,
                creating beautiful melodies,
                and just getting lost in the joy of music.
            </p>
            <li>Playing Guitar</li>
            <p>
                I absolutely love strumming the strings,
                crafting soulful tunes,
                and immersing myself in the enchanting world of music.
            </p>
            <li>Watching Marvel Movies</li>
            <p>
                Marvel movies are my go-to for a great time.
                I get to dive into the epic universe of superheroes,
                captivating stories,
                and thrilling adventures on the big screen.
            </p>
            <li>Playing Mobile Games</li>
            <p>
                I have a blast delving into exciting virtual worlds,
                solving puzzles,
                and competing with others,
                all right at my fingertips on my mobile device.
            </p>
            <li>Drawing</li>
            <p>
                Drawing is my creative outlet,
                where I sketch my thoughts and emotions,
                bringing my imagination to life through art.

            After 5 years I see myself living these dreams.
            It might not be easy to follow these dreams but all I know 
            is I want to achieve it no matter what happens. 
            There's this saying that there is no plan b for pursuing this
            career. I know someday all of the hardships for pursuing this dream
            will be worth it. For my future self, I hope you are happy and
            grateful for what I've done. I hope I meet your expectations.
            I hope I achieve your goal to be a full stack web developer. I hope
            you are working with your dream team and company. I hope you have a
            great work life balance and stay healthy. For now, I will do my
            best here for you.
